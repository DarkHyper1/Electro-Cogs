Hey! It seems you are looking to install my Dank Meme creator Cog!

# Installing the Requirements for the Dank Meme Creator Cog

Its a little tricky but doable, so lets get into it

## Prerequesties (These must be executed from the console on the machine Red is running on)
Depending on your OS, the commands will change:

Debain / Ubuntu: ```sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev```

RedHat / CentOS: ```sudo yum install mysql-devel```

Windows / MacOS: No Extra Commands!

### Since Red uses Python 3, we must also run:

Debian / Ubuntu: ```sudo apt-get install python3-dev```

RedHat / CentOS: ```sudo yum install python3-devel```

MacOS (REQUIRES HOMEBREW): ```brew install mysql-connector-c```

Windows: No Extra Commands!

## Installing The Main Package

After all the prerequesties have been installed it is now time to run (All OS):

```pip3 install mysqlclient```

# Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully installed my cog! Enjoy!
